/*
Conclusion
Users from both advertising campaigns do not differ in terms of all metrics applied, 
so WHY ROI is so much higher for Campaign ¹1.
The answer is- the Retention rate is almost twice as high for the first advertising campaign 0.22 vs 0.09. 
This leads to the fact that users from the first campaign bring us more value.
